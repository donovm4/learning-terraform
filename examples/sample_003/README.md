# Referencing existing resources

You can reference existing resources. In this configuration, we are targeting the resource we created in `run_1`. This resource group is managed outside of the `run_2` state file. Using the data source, **we are not managing / importing the resource** into the state - just referencing it.

`run_1` / `main.tf`:
```
data "azurerm_resource_group" "existing" {
  name = "learning-terraform-003"
}
```

You can then reference the object(s) for other tasks, like creating a key vault.  

`run_2` / `main.tf`:
```
resource "azurerm_key_vault" "example" {
  name = "examplekeyvault"
  location = data.azurerm_resource_group.existing.location
  resource_group_name = data.azurerm_resource_group.existing.name
  sku_name = "standard"
  tenant_id = data.azurerm_client_config.current.tenant_id

  purge_protection_enabled = false
}
```

Result:
```
run_2: âœ— terraform apply

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # azurerm_key_vault.example will be created
  + resource "azurerm_key_vault" "example" {
      + access_policy                 = (known after apply)
